## Description
Got You Cupboard is an interactive website that allows users to search for recipes using only ingredients. You can choose between a few options to filter your results based on general dietary rescritions. We used Edamam's API for recipe search results. We also built a map search in case you are missing some ingredients you can search for nearby grocery stores. For that, we utilized MapQuest's API. To build the site we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Materialize.
